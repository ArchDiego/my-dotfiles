## Dotfiles by Diego
<hr>

These Dotfiles are a compilation of the two best Dotfiles that I have tried, on the one hand there is the Qtile environment created by [Antonio Sarosi](https://github.com/antoniosarosi) and adapted to my daily use, on the other hand, there are the Dotfiles of [theCode-Breaker](https://github.com/theCode-Breaker) with its Bspwm environment.I give most of the credits to them.


### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/ArchDiego/my-dotfiles.git
